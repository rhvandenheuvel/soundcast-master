## Installation and usage:

### Caskroom with Homebrew

1. If you have [caskroom](http://caskroom.io/) installed via `homebrew` you'll be able to run `brew cask install soundcast`

That's it, you're done!

If you don't have caskroom installed, then read further.

### Standard

1. Download and install [Soundflower v2.0b2](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases/download/2.0b2/Soundflower-2.0b2.dmg) (if you have a previous version, follow [this instructions](https://support.shinywhitebox.com/hc/en-us/articles/202751790-Uninstalling-Soundflower) to uninstall it and then install v2.0b2).
2. Download the [newest version](https://github.com/andresgottlieb/soundcast/releases) of Soundcast, unzip it and drop it into your Applications folder.
3. If you want it to start automatically with your computer do [this](http://www.howtogeek.com/206178/mac-os-x-change-which-apps-start-automatically-at-login/).

## Mac OS X El Capitan

If you upgraded to Mac OS X El Capitan and Soundcast stopped working correctly, you need to upgrade Soundflower to v2.0b2. Just do the following:

1. Uninstall Soundflower following [this instructions](https://support.shinywhitebox.com/hc/en-us/articles/202751790-Uninstalling-Soundflower).
2. Download and install [Soundflower v2.0b2](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases/download/2.0b2/Soundflower-2.0b2.dmg).

Don't forget rebooting your computer between both steps.

## Development
- This app has dependencies that only work on NodeJS v0.10 (.38 and over), and uses [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).
- To package the app, use [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager):

```
electron-packager . soundcast --platform=darwin --arch=x64 --version=0.36.0 --icon=icon.icns
```
## Changelog
- **v1.x [2015/12/11]:** From this version, we'll be using Github's [Releases](https://github.com/andresgottlieb/soundcast/releases) to keep track of version changes.
- **v1.4 [2015/10/25]:** Fixed bug that didn't allow casting to Chromecasts named using spaces.
- **v1.3 [2015/10/19]:** Added ability to select specific Chromecast if you have more than one. Updated module dependencies.

## Known issues
- Unexpected behavior when trying to cast to a Chromecast while it's booting (or just booted). This is an issue in the `chromecast-osx-audio` module dependency.
- Sometimes the default `menubar` cat icon is shown for a few seconds instead of the Chromecast icon when launching Soundcast.
- Incompatible with chromecasts including double quotes (") in their name.
 
## Windows users

Soundcast only works on Mac OS X, but there exists a similar app for Windows: [Chromecast Audio Stream](https://github.com/acidhax/chromecast-audio-stream)
